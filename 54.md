# 54. Spiral Matrix

<Badge type="warning">Medium</Badge>

<Note>https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/description/</Note>

Given a matrix of *m* x *n* elements (*m* rows, *n* columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9,10,11,12]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

Startup code:

```js
var spiralOrder = function(matrix) {

}
```

**What did I learn** When comes to solving a solution, it's very important what your approach is, stick to your approach! As long as your approach goes to a solution, your code should

**My solution**

```js
var spiralOrder = function(matrix) {
    let output = [];
    let length = matrix.length;

    if(length == 0) return output;
    r2 = length - 1;

    length = matrix[0].length;
    c2 = length - 1;

    let r1 = 0, c1 = 0;
    while(r1 <= r2 && c1 <= c2) {
        for (let i = c1; i <= c2; i++) {
            output.push(matrix[r1][i])
        }
        r1++;

        for (let i = r1; i <= r2; i++) {
            output.push(matrix[i][c2])
        }
        c2--;

        if(r2 >= r1 && c2 >= c1) {
                        /* The if makes sure that our while loop is still in effect */
            for (let i = c2; i >= c1; i--) {
                output.push(matrix[r2][i])
            }
            r2--;

            for (let i = r2; i >= r1; i--) {
                output.push(matrix[i][c1])
            }
            c1++;   
        }
    }
    return output;

};
```

The idea is to separate the array with 2 sections: rowBegin (r1), rowEnd (r2). colBegin(c1), colEnd(c2).

And then we keep add, minus r1 and r2 to stimulate a spiral effect.

In the middle there is an if statement, this will make sure that our while loop conditions still holds since we have changed our parameter for comparing

**Time complexity:** O(n^2) 

**Space complexity**: O(n);
