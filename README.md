# Hello,

This is my personal notes for learning when practicing leetcode problems with the hope of landing a job one day.

I write my mistakes and what I learn for each problem, this is mostly just for myself to review but I decided to share it publicly with my friends. 

Hopefully it will be helpful for you at some points.
