# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists 

<Badge type="success">Easy</Badge>

<Note>https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/</Note>

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example:**

```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

Startup code:

```js
var mergeTwoLists = function(l1, l2) {

};
```

**What I learn?**

1.  For link-list questions, just stop make a new node if it's the end. *Don't make a new node and then make it to null, it doesn't work like that*
2.  When checking `l2.val <= l1.val` or accessing an attribute of an object, *always check if the object is null or not*.

**My solution**

```js
var mergeTwoLists = function(l1, l2) {
    let head = new ListNode(null);
    let curr = head;

    if(l1 == null && l2 == null) {
        return null;
    }

    while(l1 !== null || l2 !== null) {
        if(l1 !== null && (l2 == null || l1.val <= l2.val )) {
            curr.val = l1.val;
            l1 = l1.next;
        } else {
            curr.val = l2.val;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }

        if( l1 || l2 ) {
            /*To avoid to create new node*/
            curr.next = new ListNode(null);
        }
        curr = curr.next;
    }
    return head;
};
```

Complexity: O(n) because you go through the list once. Space: O(n) it's just a combination of 2 lists

**What I like about my solution:** It's very intuative, straight to the point of what the piece of code is doing. I generate the node on the fly of comparing between the 2 node `l1` and `l2`

**What I could do instead** The problem - which I don't like with my code is for everytime I create a new node, I'll have to check *if it is worth creating*. This checking is wrapped in a function

```js
if( l1 || l2 ) {
...
}
```

which is really cumbersome.

*Solution* The question is asking about **merging 2 lists**. So *why do we create a new node?*, why don't we just reuse our node and merge them together?

One of the solution:

```js
var mergeTwoLists = function(l1, l2) {
    let head = new ListNode(0);
    let list = head;

    while (l1 && l2) {
        if (l1.val > l2.val) {
            list.next = l2;
            l2 = l2.next;
        } else {
            list.next = l1;
            l1 = l1.next
        }

        list = list.next;
    }

        /* It will by default pick l1, if l1 is null, it will then pick l2 */
    list.next = l1 || l2;

        /* Because the first one is 0 so you need to call next to start pointing to the first node.*/
    return head.next;
};
```
