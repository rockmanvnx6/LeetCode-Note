# 560. Subarray Sum Equals K

<Badge type="warning">Medium</Badge>

<Note>https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/</Note>

Given an array of integers and an integer **k**, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to **k**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```



**Note:**

1.  The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
2.  The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer **k** is [-1e7, 1e7].

Starter code:

```js
var subarraySum = function(nums, k) {

}
```

**What I learned** You can check if a hash map contains a key in javascript by using `map.hasOwnProperty('keyname')`

**My Solution**

```js
var subarraySum = function(nums, k) {
    let i = 0; 
    let end = nums.length;
    let count = 0;
    let sum = 0;
    
    while(i < end) {
        sum = nums[i];
        let j = i+1;
        if(sum === k) count += 1;
        while (j < end) {
            sum+=nums[j];

            if(sum === k) {
                count += 1;
            }   
            j++;
        }
        i++;
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

**What I like about it** It's very readable and understandable, $O(n^2)$ complexity







**Better solution with O(n) complexity and O(1) space**

First we have to understand the idea of `runningSum` and `target`

we have: `runningSum` + `target` = `currentSum`



Thus, given an array, 

```
	[1,1,2,3,-2,0,5,1]
i:   0,1,2,3, 4,5,6,7
```

The sum from index 4 to 7 `sum(4,7)` = `sum(0,7)` - `sum(0,4)`. 

This is just some basic math, just write down on paper you will understand.



So now we're looking for a number k such that `k` = `sum(0,?)` - `sum(0,?)` 

We do know `k`, the `?` can be calculated by looping through all the possible sum.



Therefore, by looping through all sum, we have:

```
	[1,1,2,3,-2,0,5,1], k = 5
i:   0,1,2,3, 4,5,6,7   // index
s: 0 1 2 4 7  5 5 10 11 // sum(0,i)
```

So to find how many subset's sum `k` is `5`, all we have to do is check

```
do we have ?  (? - k)
----------------------
do we have -5 (0 - 5)?
do we have -4 (1 - 5)?
do we have -3 (2 - 5)?
do we have -1 (4 - 5)?
do we have 2  (7 - 5)? yes
do we have 0  (5 - 5)? yes
do we have 0  (5 - 5)? yes
do we have 5 (10 - 5)? yes
do we have 6 (11 - 5)?
```

Now what next is to find the number of appearance in the subset. So we have:

```
[sum]: [number of occurence of sum]
0: 1
1: 1
2: 1
4: 1
7: 1
5: 2
10: 1
11: 1
```

So we have to redo the same thing again, but this time, add the occurence of sum.

```
do we have ?  (? - k)
----------------------
do we have -5 (0 - 5)?
do we have -4 (1 - 5)?
do we have -3 (2 - 5)?
do we have -1 (4 - 5)?
do we have 2  (7 - 5)? yes, count += 1
do we have 0  (5 - 5)? yes, count += 1
do we have 0  (5 - 5)? yes, count += 1
do we have 5 (10 - 5)? yes, count += 2
do we have 6 (11 - 5)?
```

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */

var subarraySum = function(nums, k) {
    let sum = 0;
    let count = 0;
    let preSum = {};
    preSum[0] = 1;
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
        
        if(preSum.hasOwnProperty(sum - k)) {
            count += preSum[sum-k];
        }
        
        if(preSum.hasOwnProperty(sum)) {
            preSum[sum]++;
        } else {
            preSum[sum] = 1;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```



**Complexity:**

-   Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of node.
-   Space complexity: O(n) since it's the recursion stack
