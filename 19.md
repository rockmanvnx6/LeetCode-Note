# 19. Remove Nth Node from End of List 

 <Badge type="warning">Medium</Badge>

<Note>https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/</Note>

Given a linked list, remove the *n*-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example:**

```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Note:**

Given *n* will always be valid.

**Follow up:**

Could you do this in one pass?

Startup codes:

```js
var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {

}
```

**What did I learn** You can actually create a range between the two notes and move it along. Say if the question is asking to remove the Nth Node from the end, you can create a second pointer that different than the first pointer n iterator.

**My Solution**

```js
var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {
    let number = 0;
    let cursor = head;

    while(cursor) {
        cursor = cursor.next;
        number++;
    }

    let target = number - n;

    if(number == 1 && n == 1) {
        return null;
    }

    let i = 0;
    cursor = head;

    while(i < target - 1) {
        cursor = cursor.next;        
        i++;
    }
    if(target == 0) {
        head = cursor.next;
    } else if(cursor.next) {
        cursor.next = cursor.next.next;   
    }

    return head;
};
```

**What I like about it** The solution is easy to understand, easy to read. However, I could've just reuse some of my variables for counting instead of making a new one

**What should I do instead**

```js
var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {
    let cursor = head;
    let ahead = head;

    for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ahead = ahead.next;
    }

    /* If there is no element next to it. */
    if(!ahead) return head.next;

    while(ahead.next) {
        /* Keep going until the end of the list */
        cursor = cursor.next;
        ahead = ahead.next;
    }

    cursor.next = cursor.next.next;

    return head;
};
```
