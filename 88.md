# 88. Merge Sorted Array

<Badge type="success">Easy</Badge>

<Note>https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/</Note>

Given two sorted integer arrays *nums1* and *nums2*, merge *nums2* into *nums1* as one sorted array.

**Note:**

- The number of elements initialized in *nums1* and *nums2* are *m* and *n* respectively.
- You may assume that *nums1* has enough space (size that is greater or equal to *m* + *n*) to hold additional elements from *nums2*.

**Example:**

```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

Startup code:

```js
var merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {

}
```

**What I learned** If the array is sorted, then it means something. Either start with the last element of the array, or start with the beginning.

This problem requires 3 pointer, one point to the last 0, second one point to the first array, last element. Third one point to the second array last element.

If `nums1[m] > nums2[n]`. Simply replace `nums1[current]` with `nums1[m]` and `m--`. The same will do for `nums2[n]`.

**My solution**

```js
var merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {
    let current = nums1.length - 1;
    n-=1;
    m-=1;
    while(current >= 0) {
        if(nums1[m] > nums2[n] || n < 0) {
            nums1[current] = nums1[m];
            m--;
        } else {
            nums1[current] = nums2[n];
            n--;
        }
        current --;
    }
}
```

**What I like about it** Code is clean, no redundant if statements.

**What could be better** Since BCR is O(n). This is the most optimal solution.

**Complexity** Time: O(n) Space: O(1)
